* Flypitch

* Goals
The Flypitch project aims to produce a formal proof of the independence of the continuum hypothesis. We will produce the formal proof based on the conventional human-readable account of the proof, [[https://www.github.com/flypitch/flypitch-notes/][located here]].

* Compilation
To compile some parts of the Flypitch project, you will need a compiled copy of ~mathlib~ on your marchine. After cloning the repository to ~flypitch~, navigate to ~flypitch~ and run
#+BEGIN_SRC
leanpkg init
git checkout -- .gitignore
leanpkg add PATH/TO/mathlib
#+END_SRC

After this, you can (re)build the project using ~leanpkg build~.
