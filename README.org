* Flypitch
* Goals
The Flypitch project aims to produce a formal proof of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_hypothesis#Independence_from_ZFC][independence of the continuum hypothesis]].
* Documentation 
A conventional human-readable account of the proof written in type-theoretic foundations, upon which some parts of the formalization will be based, is [[https://www.github.com/flypitch/flypitch-notes/][located here]].
* Compilation
To compile the Flypitch project, you will need [[https://leanprover.github.io/][Lean 3.4.1]] and a compiled copy of ~mathlib~ on your machine. After cloning the repository to ~flypitch~, navigate to ~flypitch~ and run
#+BEGIN_SRC
leanpkg init flypitch
git checkout -- .gitignore
leanpkg add PATH/TO/mathlib
#+END_SRC

After this, you can (re)build the project using ~leanpkg build~.

Installation instructions for Lean (using ~elan~) can be found [[https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/blob/master/docs/elan.md][here]].
